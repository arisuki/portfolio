        <h3>Hello, I'm Alice!</h3>
          <p>🍁
            With roots in Romania, I was raised in the vibrant Canadian
            landscape. Now, I'm a French language elementary school
            teacher in the bustling city of Toronto, moonlighting as an artist,
            musician, coder and content creator by night. 🍂

          🎮  My passion for web development was ignited in the early 00's
            through Geocities sites showcasing my teenage fanart and poetry (which has mysteriously disappeared into oblivion). 
            </p>
            <p>
            🖥️ I made sites for
            everyone in my life using just Notepad and a web 1.0 sense of
            aesthetics, from my mother's painting portfolio to my college video
            game club's blog. A lot has changed in the world of web dev in those
            intervening years, but that spark of curiosity and passion remains.

        <h3>Hello, I'm Alice!</h3>
          <p>
            With roots in Romania, I was raised in the vibrant Canadian
            landscape. Now, I'm a French language elementary school
            teacher in the bustling city of Toronto, moonlighting as an artist,
            musician, coder and content creator by night.

            My passion for web development was ignited in the early 00's
            through Geocities sites showcasing my teenage fanart and poetry (which has mysteriously disappeared into oblivion). 
            </p>
            <p>
            I made sites for
            everyone in my life using just Notepad and a web 1.0 sense of
            aesthetics, from my mother's painting portfolio to my college video
            game club's blog. A lot has changed in the world of web dev in those
            intervening years, but that spark of curiosity and passion remains.
